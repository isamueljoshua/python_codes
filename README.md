# PYTHON CODES
These programs are a collection of codes from my python3 journey so far.

Here you can find sample codes to the basics, connecting to databases, automation, networking, etc.
Some of these are my own, while some I have picked up from various resources. All and most of these resources can be found in my blog, do check it out!! - >

I am very eager to collect more simple code samples such as these, so that it can help anyone learning python or using python on a daily basis
